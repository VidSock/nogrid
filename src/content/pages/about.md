Here’s an example I think of a lot: when you select something to watch in the HBO Max app for iOS, the whole UI animates to the right and deep down in my bones this feels wrong. Because now all of a sudden that menu (in my mental model of this app) is now off to the right. But it should be off to the *left* of my screen because when I click the back button I want to swipe this whole UI back to where I just was, sort of like a carousel.
